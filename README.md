### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Pike, and I'm an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at the [University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)](http://www.nottingham.edu.cn). My research interests are primarily focussed on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically exploring ways of measuring individual's mental activity as they engage with their work or everyday activities. I teach a broad range of subjects in Computer Science, which currently include:

+ COMP1048: Databases & Interfaces
+ COMP2044: Human-Computer Interaction
+ COMP3050: Individual Dissertation (Module Coordinator)
